# Async Nhentai scrapper

A weirdo's first choice for a python project. If the read me seem small it's because i made it last minute. And also i did not do any research on how github works.
btw there's a download button on the nhentai gallery just use that

## How to use

**If you're blocked from visting nhentai please use a vpn**

1. Download Python
2. Download this respository
3. Type in command prompt py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
4. The possible format is 
	1. Nhentai.py [num] 
	2. Nhentai.py [#num] 
	3. Nhentai.py [num] [num] [num] [num] and a combination of these probably i didn't test it more than twice
